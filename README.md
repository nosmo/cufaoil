###### _[Cú Faoil](https://www.tearma.ie/q/c%C3%BA%20faoil/ga/) is the Irish word for wolfhound. Due to convention and restriction, the fada is dropped in various places_

Cú Faoil is a simple script for logging into and then dumping historical information about bin collections from the [Greyhound bin company](https://greyhound.ie/).

`cufaoil.py` is a simple script for dumping this information. The `greyhound` module it uses contains all of the login/query logic and can be reused elsewhere.
